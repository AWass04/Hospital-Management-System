# Hospital-Management-System
I have been challenged to create a patient record management system for a hospital that will help the efficiency of storing and retrieving patient profiles, diagnosisâ€™ and lab results. It is windows-based as is designed for hospital staff access only.

Depenedant on if a user is classed as a 'Receptionist', 'Doctor' or 'Admin' depends on what they are able to access and edit.

## Receptionist
Receptions can book and cancel patients appointments, search for patients, view patient records and update patient information.

## Doctor
Doctors can view their appointments, search for patients and add notes to patient records.

## Admin
Admin are able to view all hospital staff, create receptionist logins, create doctor logins and change any hospital staff's roles.
